abstract="This paper presents algorithms for the automatic synthesis of real-time controllers by finding a winning strategy for certain games defined by the timed-automata of Alur and Dill. In such games, the outcome depends on the players' actions as well as on their timing. We believe that these results will pave the way for the application of program synthesis techniques to the construction of real-time embedded systems from their specifications.",
